Websites onto the Page
Entire Websites can be loaded onto your web page, but those website MUST ALLOW IFRAME!
If the website allows iframe, then you can use an iframe to place that website onto your web page.
Keep in mind that some websites will effect loading time if you load them at the start of the application. If a website takes much time to load, then it is a good idea to allow the user the choice of loading it or not, by using a push button option to load the content.

The functionality of the website will be the same on your webpage.
