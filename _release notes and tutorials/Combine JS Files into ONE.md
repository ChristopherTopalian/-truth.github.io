HOW TO COMBINE MULTIPLE JS FILES
INTO ONE JS FILE

We first open our js folder.

We type in the address bar of our js folder cmd

This opens our js folder in the Command prompt

We type in the words
copy *.js main.js

and press enter

This creates a new file, that is named main.js

This new file contains all of the .js files in ONE file.

<!-- Now, in our html code, we can type -->
<script src = "main.js"></script>

This single file method, makes it much easier to upload our js code to our website. 

Now we upload our 6 files to any free server, such as weebly: 
TopalianGameEngineDataNavigator.html
ourStyle.css
main.js
TopalianData.js
TopalianPlayerData.js 
TopalianStructureData.js

Thus, to deploy our game, we just use any free server such as weebly or wordpress that allows embed code.

We upload each of our files to weebly for example.

We then get the url of each of the files that we upload.

We use those urls as the source for the code of our game engine.

So in summary:
We uploaded 6 files in total to weebly for free.
We got the url of each of these files.
We use these urls as the source for our game engine code.
This easily deploys our game for free.

We are using 100% JavaScript, HTML, CSS, which means that almost the entire world can play our game immediately using their browser.
